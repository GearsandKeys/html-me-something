                <h2>Stormlight Archive- By Brandon Sanderson</h2>

                <p>The first book of the Stormlight Archive made its premier in  2010, but I didn't read it until 2017. When traveling with a friend to Nashville in the summer of 2015, he recommended the first of the series “Way of Kings” to me and I put it at the bottom of a list of books to read. Two years later I made my way to the book after finishing A Wise Man's Fear and fell deeply into it. The author, Brandon Sanderson is famous for his incredible world building and his sophistication in his characters, magic, and society. The story follows various people with their own problems in a kingdom at war. The nobles have increible blades that cut through anything and of course the lower class is taken advantage of to fuel their extravagance. Each of the main characters finds themselves part of a bigger destiny and are faced with many moral dilemmas while gaining power to fight an oncoming darkness.</p>

                <h2>The Lord of the Rings By J.R.R. Tolkien</h2>

                <p>The Lord of the Rings is a standard for most fantasy literature. The books fueled my imagination and helped foster hope when all seems lost, and a strong sense for doing what’s right. I can still remember ordering the Hobbit (a prequel of sorts) from the scholastic book order forms. The books follow a group of various characters as they attempt the impossible to stop evil, each splitting into doing their own part in what seems impossible odds. The allegory and connections to Tolkien's own experiences from World War Two are incredible and still a treasure to be read to boys and girls at bedtime.</p>

                <h2>The King Killer Chronicle - Patrick Rothfuss</h2>
                <img src="https://imgix.bustle.com/uploads/image/2020/6/10/10b50d35-3060-442f-a7bd-aaef5e261689-0e4947f7-a5a6-4336-b2d6-22d563c1276e-the-kingkiller-chronicle-tv-show.jpg?w=1200&h=630&q=70&fit=crop&crop=faces&fm=jpg" alt="kvothe" width="500" height="200">
                <p>The first book of the King Killer Chronicle, “The Name of the Wind”, follows a boy named Kvothe with fiery red hair as he is put through a series of fascinating and traumatic events. However, Kvothe has an incredible intelligence and musical talent. He aspires to be able to control the wind by a type of magic called “naming”. As a musician, I enjoyed the blend of unique fantasy and Patrick Rothfuss’s connections made to music. The unfortunate truth of the Kingkiller Chronicle series is that the third book still hasn't been released and it is unclear when it will be finished as Patrick Rothfuss drags his feet. You can’t rush art.</p>

                <h2>The Dark Tower - Stephen King</h2>
                <img src="https://i.imgur.com/nDERK.jpg" alt="Dark Tower in the Distance" width="400" height="300">
                <p>The Dark Tower is a series of eight books from Stephen King, ranging from the years of 1978(Original publishing of the Gunslinger)-2012(Wind in the Key Hole). The book has one of the best opening lines of any book I've ever read, “The man in black fled across the desert, and the gunslinger followed.”. The book has a bit of a rough start, and the first three books feel like they were written by different authors. (I personally blame that on Stephen King’s substance abuse). It follows a cowboy who is a  knight of sort, chasing after an evil man hoping to reach a “Dark Tower”. A hub or sorts of all time and space. By the time the series has finished, Stephen King has shown his incredible ability to write his own language and develop a story that covers time travel, destiny, language, story telling, redemption, and all the other parts that make a great story. By the end of it I couldn’t help but feel it was a reflection on Stephen King’s own addiction and feelings of being a tool to a story as a writer.</p>

                <h2>Dune - Brian Herbert</h2>
                <img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/proxy/gFzCmW1kNeX6PuipwtSkNM4-qkBkb3I1h6XrTUdQYSA9CuzJa_I8hFstzu2ONyPZfO-d1ClTIsaopXVBrZFSVaGUfglpofIo4wWTQymgcz2xxk3ZWOjZMOd-nS2tBGbKx-WCTrlwSgsm9So9xiOplil5dqaS-zu_4h_tIgk48Q" alt="Sand Wormds" width="500" height="200">
                <p>Dune was written in 1965, and yet it is still held as a masterpiece today. If Tolkien is a main inspiration for fantasy writers, then Dune must be the standard and inspiration that all science fiction books post 1965 must be compared to. The story follows the Atreides noble family as they try to battle against political maneuvers after being moved to Arrakiskas, a desert planet with “spice” that is highly sought after, and giant sandworms that make the mining of spice difficult. The family is betrayed and put in a difficult situation and follows the difficulties and rise of the young Paul Atreides against the Baron Vladimir Harkonnen. </p>

                <h2>The Stand - Stephen King</h2>

                <p>The Stand by Stephen King is a favorite Stephen King novel by many of his fans. I have read from Stephen King himself that The Stand and the Dark Tower are his two attempts to write a story with a band of adventurers and an epic quest against evil in a similar vein of Lord of the Rings. Instead of going typical fantasy like many writers do in the footsteps of Tolkien, the Stand takes place in modern times (1985, the book was first published in 1980). It starts with an epidemic of a man made virus wiping the Earth clean of about 95% of the human population and first observes what the survivors do and how society breaks down with an imminent tragedy. The later part of the book tells the story of the survivors flocking together to either be on the side of good or evil and the “stand” that takes place against that evil. </p>

                <h2>The Dresden Files - Jim Butcher</h2>
                <img src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/d4/ca/3c/d4ca3c4a47795aaeb6886574f866ed9a.jpg" alt="The main characters of the Dresden Files" width="500" height="200">
                <p>The Dresden Files are written by an author who lived in Independence, MO for quite a while. I met Jim Butcher and his family long before I read his books, but saw that he had quite a fan base. After reading his books, I can see why. Jim Butcher’s books have a detective noir feel to them with lots of suspense and rising action. He puts an interesting spin on his books by having them modern day (2010’s) and including many elements in fantasy but blending them in his own creative way. I personally am a fan of urban fantasy. I think we all have thoughts deep in the back of our mind like, “What if that abandoned school from the 30’s is haunted?”. Jim grabs these concepts and makes them a reality in clever ways that cause me to daydream about my own environment and wonder the stories hidden in their brickwork. The main character is Harry Dresden, a detective wizard as he works on stipend and by contract as a private detective for people that are desperate enough to go to a man labeled in the phone book as a “wizard”.</p>
